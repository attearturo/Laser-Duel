# Laser Duel
Laser Duel is a multiplayer wearable game where players try to point a laser pointer at their opponent's socks while dodging their opponent's laser.

# Overview

Wearable technologies and ubiquitous games are a new kind of computer science that, instead of isolating human beings in artificial digital worlds, provide a means of continuous and integrated expression with our social and physical environment.

Although they do not have enough diffusion now, some day they will become such an important part of our lives as laptops, mobile phones or even the written word, a completely new medium that becomes meritorious of exploration and development.

Laser Duel is not only a game with an innovative interface, it is also a proposal to integrate the physical and digital world more and more.

# How it works

Each player is equipped with a pair of socks, in which different electronic components are installed. 

These components are responsible for processing the information that enters and translate it into physical, visual and sound stimuli for the player.
